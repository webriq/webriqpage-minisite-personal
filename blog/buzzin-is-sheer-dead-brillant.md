**Buzzin is sheer dead brilliant**

There is so much going on that perhaps we forget to publish our work, events and things that are happening - or maybe we have that wee bit that says - maybe I'm not good enough.

I went to the Opening Ceremony of the Commonwealth Games - Glasgow 2014 - the best games in the 20-year history and I was so proud to be Scottish! Just a bloody shame the twally that was filming did not understand our history and our culture.

It was mesmerising! It made you so proud to be Scottish - but dear Jossey what I saw the TV recording - that idgit missed the ethos and the cuteness of what we are all about.

Also the Queen had to stop her speech because we cheered her so much! And we cheered the English!! My pledge is to make Buzzin viral!
