<p>There is so much going on that perhaps we forget to publish our work, events and things that are happening - or maybe we have that wee bit that says - maybe I&#39;m not good enough.</p>
<p>I went to the Opening Ceremony of the Commonwealth Games - Glasgow 2014 - the best games in the 20-year history and I was so proud to be Scottish! Just a bloody shame the twally that was filming did not understand our history and our culture.</p>
<p>It was mesmerising! It made you so proud to be Scottish - but dear Jossey what I saw the TV recording - that idgit missed the ethos and the cuteness of what we are all about. </p>
<p>Also the Queen had to stop her speech because we cheered her so much! And we cheered the English!! My pledge is to make Buzzin viral!</p>
